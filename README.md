### Hi there 👋

I'm Patrick. This is my personal account for pet projects.
Some things I'm working on:

1. 🌜 A [JSON version of the Apollo 13 Air-to-Ground technical transcript](https://github.com/paddyredbeard/apollo-13-json)
2. 🇼  A [Wordle Helper](https://github.com/paddyredbeard/wordle-helper) app, just for kicks

### I like

- Bikes 🚲
- Tacos 🌮
