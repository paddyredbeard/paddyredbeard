### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Patrick. This is my personal account for pet projects.
Some things I'm working on:

> ğŸŒœ A [JSON version of the Apollo 13 Air-to-Ground technical transcript](https://github.com/paddyredbeard/apollo-13-json)  
>
> ğŸ‡¼  A [Wordle Helper](https://github.com/paddyredbeard/wordle-helper) app, just for kicks  

I like bikes ğŸš².

And tacos ğŸŒ®.
