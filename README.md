### Hi there 👋

I'm Patrick. This is my personal account for pet projects.
Some things I'm working on:

🌜 A [JSON version of the Apollo 13 Air-to-Ground technical transcript](https://github.com/paddyredbeard/apollo-13-json)  
🇼  A [Wordle Helper](https://github.com/paddyredbeard/wordle-helper) app, just for kicks  

I like bikes 🚲.
And tacos 🌮.
